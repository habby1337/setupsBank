# 🏦 setupsBank 
A better way to keep and share setups for Assetto Corsa.

## ❓ How does it work?
It uses github action with issues to automatically add the setups. It's open-source, you can check it out!

## ➕ How to add setups?
You can <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/habby1337/setupsBank/issues/new?assignees=habby1337&labels=Awaiting+Approval&projects=&template=setup-submit.md&title=%5BSETUP%5D+car%40track">click here</a> or go to the issue section, create a new issue and use the "Setup Submit" template, fill it out and submit.


## 🤝 How can I help you?
Surely by adding your setups, but if you mean to help with the code/actions feel free to submit a PR! 😊



## ✨ What will be added:
- [ ] Web interface for easily submitting and browsing setups
- [ ] CLI / AC APP to automatically download an install setups?
- [ ] Content Manager integration (not sure how)
